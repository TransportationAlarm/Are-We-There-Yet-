==============

By Karl Stenerud

### A better reachability for a modern age.


Introduction
------------

A long time ago in an Xcode far away, Apple provided "Reachability", an example Objective-C wrapper to demonstrate the SystemConfiguration Reachability APIs. On the whole it works well enough, but it could be so much more!

KSReachability takes reachability to the next level.


Features
--------

- Reachability to the network in general, to a host, or to an IPV4 or IPV6 address.
- Notifications/callbacks via NSNotification, blocks, and KVO.
- Fetching status values doesn't block.
- Callbacks and KVO always occur on the main thread, so it's UI-safe.
- KSReachableOperation: A one-shot operation to perform when reachability is established.
- Supports iOS and Mac OS X.
- Can be built with or without ARC, in CLANG or GCC.

Usage
-----

#### Import:
    #import "KSReachability.h"

#### Create a KSReachability object:
    self.reachability = [KSReachability reachabilityToHost:hostname];

#### Use blocks:
    self.reachability.onReachabilityChanged = ^(KSReachability* reachability)
    {
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (blocks)", reachability.reachable);
    };

#### Or use NSNotifications:
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                             selector:@selector(onReachabilityChanged:)
                                                 name:kDefaultNetworkReachabilityChangedNotification
                                               object:nil];
    ...

    self.reachability.notificationName = kDefaultNetworkReachabilityChangedNotification;
    ...

    - (void) onReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification*) notification
    {
        KSReachability* reachability = (KSReachability*)notification.object;
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (NSNotification)", reachability.reachable);
    }

#### Or use KVO:
    [self.reachability addObserver:self
                        forKeyPath:@"reachable"
                           options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew
                           context:NULL];
    ...

    - (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath
                          ofObject:(id)object
                            change:(NSDictionary *)change
                           context:(void *)context
    {
        KSReachability* reachability = (KSReachability*)object;
        NSLog(@"Reachability changed to %d (KVO)", reachability.reachable);
    }

#### Add a reachable operation:
    // Create a one-shot operation that gets fired once the host is reachable.
    self.reachableOperation = [KSReachableOperation operationWithHost:hostname
                                                            allowWWAN:NO
                                               onReachabilityAchieved:^
                               {
                                   [self showAlertWithTitle:@"One-time message"
                                                    message:@"Host is reachable!"];
                               }];

Caveats
-------

### The Meaning of Reachability

As per [Apple's SCNetworkReachability documentation](https://developer.apple.com/LIBRARY/IOS/documentation/SystemConfiguration/Reference/SCNetworkReachabilityRef/Reference/reference.html), a remote host is considered reachable when a data packet addressed to that host **can leave the local device** (i.e. the host is **theoretically** reachable). It does **NOT** guarantee that data will actually be received by the host or that the host will respond to a connection request! For example, if the host has a DNS record, but the host itself is down, it will **still** be considered **reachable**.

### Delays Due to DNS Lookups

KSReachability must do a DNS lookup to determine reachability to a host by name. Since this lookup can take upwards of 10 seconds in extreme cases, it is performed in the background. As a consequence, a newly created KSReachability object will always have its state set to unreachable until this lookup completes. If you need the true reachability to a host, you must wait for the "initialized" property to change to YES (it supports KVO). As an alternative, you can set the callback "onInitializationComplete".


Full Example

I've included a full example project in this repository.

In **iOSReachability**, see **ViewController.h** and **ViewController.m** for details.

In **MacReachability**, see **AppDelegate.h** and **AppDelegate.m** for details.
