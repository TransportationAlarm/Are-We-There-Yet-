# Final Project - BuzMe

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## App Description:
BuzMe uses the [Google Places API & GoogleMaps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/ios/)

Model Classes: PreviousTrips (For Previous History Screen, as well as destinations drop down on home screen), TimePicker (To populate alert time Picker on settings page), User (To store previous destinations)

Parse: 

Tables - User, Destination

Columns for User: username, password 

Columns for Destination: start point, end point, distance, time

This app allows a user to input a certain location where they need to go, and an alarm will alert 
them when they are getting close to their desired location. This app is specifically designed for 
those who sleep or fall asleep on public transportation, such as busses or trains. 

## User Stories



The following **required** functionality is completed:
- [x] Allow user to sign up/log in to store account info
- [ ] Alerts user (via alarm or vibrate) when they are approaching desination
- [ ] Add in Google Maps SDK and Tracks user's current location and end destination
- [x] Implement Settings Page

- [ ] Change the time that the alarm alerts the user 
- [ ] Allow user to set start location


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
